### Level 07:

**Analysis of Level 07:**
- Investigated the environment and found a scheduled script in the mail for `level07`.
- The script executes every 2 minutes and runs `/usr/sbin/openarenaserver`.
- Created a script in `/opt/openarenaserver/` to execute `getflag`.
- Waited for the scheduled script to run and retrieved the flag.

### Level 08:

**Exploiting Level 08:**
- Analyzed the code using `ltrace` and identified the use of `strstr("token", .. )`.
- Linked the `token` file to another file and read the second one to obtain the flag.
- Executed `ln -s ~/token /tmp/tt`.

### Level 09:

**Analysis of Level 09:**
- Understood that the program increments each character in the input by its order.
- Created a script to decrement the input and read the `token`.
- Used `access()` to check authorization before opening a file, and exploited it.
- Created a tmp file, linked it with `token`, and read the flag.

### Level 10:

**Exploiting Level 10:**
- The program sends a file to the host, checks permissions using `access()`.
- Created a tmp file, provided it to `access`, and linked it with `token` to read the flag.
- Executed a loop to exploit the file continuously.

### Level 11:

**Exploiting Level 11:**
- Examined the LUA code.
- Connected to localhost on port 5151 using `nc`.
- Provided the password "echo `getflag` > /tmp/res" to obtain the flag.
